### Introduction
This project is intended to give you a chance to flex some of the new items you’ve been absorbing over the past few lessons. This time it’s a sign-up form for an imaginary service.

### Assignment
> #### Step 1: Set up and planning
> 1. Set up your git repository (refer to past projects if you need a refresher).
> 2. Set up your HTML and CSS files with some dummy content, just to make sure you have everything linked correctly.
> 3. Download a full-resolution copy of the design file, and get a general idea for how you’re going to need to lay things out in your HTML document.
