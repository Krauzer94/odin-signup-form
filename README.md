### Introduction
This project is intended to give you a chance to flex some of the new items you’ve been absorbing over the past few lessons. This time it’s a sign-up form for an imaginary service.

### Assignment
> #### Step 1: Set up and planning
> 1. Set up your git repository (refer to past projects if you need a refresher).
> 2. Set up your HTML and CSS files with some dummy content, just to make sure you have everything linked correctly.
> 3. Download a full-resolution copy of [the design file](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/5f37d43908ef92499e95a9b90fc3cc291a95014c/html_css/project-sign-up-form/sign-up-form.png), and get a general idea for how you’re going to need to lay things out in your HTML document.
> #### Step 2: Gather assets
> 1. The design has a large background-image, so go find and download an image you want to use for that section. The one in the design can be found on [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/photos/green-leaf-plant-in-close-up-photography-25xggax4bSA), but feel free to select your own. Be sure to credit the creator of your image!
> 2. Pick an external font for the ‘logo’ section. We’ve used [Norse Bold](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/theodinproject/efdc2888072f409e687d31dc580595dbe4fe0ff4/app/assets/fonts/Norse-Bold.otf), but you can use any font you like.
> 3. For the image-sidebar, we’ve used this [Odin logo](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/5f37d43908ef92499e95a9b90fc3cc291a95014c/html_css/project-sign-up-form/odin-lined.png).
